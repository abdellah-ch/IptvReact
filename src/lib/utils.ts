/*
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx": This line imports the ClassValue type and the clsx function from the clsx library. clsx is a utility function commonly used in React projects to conditionally concatenate class names together. The ClassValue type likely represents the types of values that can be passed as arguments to clsx.

import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge": This line imports the twMerge function from the tailwind-merge library. This library is related to Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework. twMerge is likely a function used to merge Tailwind CSS classes.

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) { ... }: This line defines a function named cn (short for "classNames" perhaps). It's exported, meaning it can be imported and used in other files. This function takes in any number of arguments of type ClassValue (which were imported from clsx), using TypeScript's rest parameter syntax (...inputs: ClassValue[]). This means you can pass in multiple class names as arguments.

return twMerge(clsx(inputs)): Inside the cn function, it calls clsx with the spread array of inputs, which concatenates the class names together based on certain conditions (e.g., whether they are truthy or falsy). Then, the result of clsx is passed to twMerge, which likely merges the Tailwind CSS classes.

So, in summary, this function cn provides a convenient way to merge and handle CSS classes, leveraging the functionality of both clsx and tailwind-merge libraries. It's useful for dynamically generating class names in React components.
